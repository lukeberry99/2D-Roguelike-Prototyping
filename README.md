# 2D Rougelike Prototyping
 Prototyping for an in development 2D Roguelike

Contains a few scenes, two are 'handmade' tile maps, with vector based movement and the most basic
enemy AI possible. Includes a save / load system, pickups, collectables, colliders, attacks, etc

The others are experiments in procedural generation, for both dungeons and caverns, as well as 
tile based movement.

This is in a terrible state, if for some reason someone is reading this... Stop...
